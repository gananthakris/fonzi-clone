## 🎤 Talking Points for Founders

**"I built a 32% functional clone of Fonzi.ai in ~8 hours"**

- Deployed frontend: https://fonzi-clone.vercel.app
- 22-model GraphQL backend with Amplify Gen 2
- Custom design system matching your editorial brutalist aesthetic
- Full auth system (Cognito + Google SSO, 5 user groups)
- 13 Lambda scaffolds ready for AI logic
- Production deployment with CI/CD

**"This demonstrates I can:"**

1. Move fast (8 hours to production)
2. Think systemically (22-model data architecture)
3. Ship quality (TypeScript strict, minimal debt)
4. Understand your product (Match Day, fraud prevention, incentives)
5. Work independently (self-directed, problem-solved build issues)

**"What I'd do next:"**

- Week 1: Finish marketing pages + deploy Amplify sandbox
- Week 2-3: Build candidate onboarding + company portal
- Month 2: Integrate Bedrock for AI screening
- Month 3: Complete Match Day engine + payments

## 📞 Questions Founders Might Ask

**Q: Why clone Fonzi specifically?**
A: The Match Day concept is brilliant - it solves coordination problems in hiring. I wanted to understand the architecture needed to build it at scale.

**Q: How did you figure out the tech stack?**
A: Researched your public site, analyzed the UX patterns, and chose AWS Amplify Gen 2 for scalability. Cognito handles multi-group auth, DynamoDB scales with traffic, Lambda for AI operations.

**Q: What would you do differently?**
A: If building from scratch, I'd start with candidate portal (highest value) before marketing pages. Also would use feature flags for phased rollout of Match Day.

**Q: Can you finish it?**
A: Yes. Foundation is done (hardest part). Remaining work is features not infrastructure. With clear requirements, 2-3 months to full feature parity.

**Q: What's the most impressive part?**
A: The 22-model GraphQL schema with proper auth rules. It models the entire Match Day lifecycle: candidate → screening → matching → offers → interviews → placement → billing.
